            <h2>
                How i got into coding!
            </h2>
    
            <p>
               I am a solo web developer who is passionate about making and sharing projects,
               And i am excited to say that Nature's Deck had been my one of the first and best projects ever,
               I loved nature ever since i was a kid and to make a website around plants was an exciting idea to me.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                At an early age i was alot into science fiction shows and movies,
                i wanted to do something awesome like make a robot or create something cool,
                i first started coding around 12, i was introduced on how to make game through code.
                My first language was c# and i used game engines like unity to make games,
                i enjoyed it alot but than i delve deeper into the world of programming
                finding out about so many things i didnt knew.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was at first kinda overwhelmed, even though i was young i felt like i should probably
                have a clear direction of where i want to go(which i didnt had :/ ) considering my interest in programming, i tried some things
                and eventually got introduced to web-development. So i dedicated myself to actually learn something and went for it.

            <h2>
                How i Created Nature's Deck
            </h2>

            <p>
                After i felt like i had enough skill in web-dev i decided to try and make something,
                i wanted to make something original to prove that i actually learned something and not just
                copy of a toturial, i didnt wanted to make a youtube clone or a clone of a website,
                so i was looking for ideas while watching some web-designing videos when i got the idea of a card like deck website.
                I did made some similar layouts during my learning so i felt i was confident enough to do it and create a original layout.

            </p>

            <p>
                I was still somewhat unsure of this idea while browsing through internet for some plants biography
                but wasnt able to find any which would provide quick info on plants so i thought maybe that could work as a first project?
                I created a some-what prototype first visioning the layout in a side-project and it looked pretty awesome so i decided to 
                move forward with this project.
