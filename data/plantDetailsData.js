        "characteristics": [
            "Wheat (<i>Triticum</i>) is a cereal grain that serves as a staple food for billions of people worldwide.",
            "It is one of the oldest cultivated crops, domesticated over 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent.",
            "Wheat plants grow between 2–4 feet (60–120 cm) tall, featuring hollow stems and narrow leaves.",
            "The grain is enclosed in a protective husk and can be classified into different varieties, including hard and soft wheat, based on protein content.",
            "Wheat is highly versatile and is used in baking, cooking, and as an ingredient in numerous processed foods."
        ],
        "region": [
            "Originally from the Fertile Crescent, wheat is now grown worldwide in temperate climates.",
            "Major producers include China, India, Russia, the United States, and France.",
            "Thrives in well-drained, loamy or clay-rich soils with a pH between 6.0–7.5.",
            "Requires moderate rainfall (15–30 inches or 380–760 mm annually) and grows best in temperatures between 50°F–77°F (10°C–25°C)."
        ],
        "cultivation": [
            "<strong>Planting Conditions</strong>:<br> - Requires fertile, well-draining soil with moderate moisture levels.<br> - Grows best in full sunlight for optimal photosynthesis and grain development.<br> - Suitable for both dryland and irrigated farming methods.",
            
            "<strong>Propagation & Planting</strong>:<br> - Propagated from seeds sown directly into the soil.<br> - Planting occurs in fall for winter wheat and in early spring for spring wheat.<br> - Seeds are sown at a depth of 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) and spaced evenly to allow proper root growth.",
            
            "<strong>Watering & Growth</strong>:<br> - Requires moderate water supply, with consistent moisture needed during germination and early growth.<br> - Tolerates dry conditions better than some cereals but benefits from irrigation in arid regions.<br> - Matures in about 100–150 days, depending on the variety and climate.",
            
            "<strong>Pest & Disease Control</strong>:<br> - Common pests include aphids, Hessian flies, and armyworms.<br> - Susceptible to fungal diseases like rust, powdery mildew, and fusarium head blight.<br> - Crop rotation, disease-resistant varieties, and proper field management help minimize issues."
        ],
        "uses": [
            "Wheat is a primary ingredient in bread, pasta, noodles, and baked goods.",
            "It is processed into flour for a wide range of food products.",
            "Wheat straw is used for animal bedding, mulch, and biofuel production.",
            "Some varieties, such as durum wheat, are specifically cultivated for making pasta and semolina products.",
            "Contains essential nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fiber, making it a key food source globally."
