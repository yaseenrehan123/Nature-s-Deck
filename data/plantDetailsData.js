        ],
        region: [
            `Apple trees thrive in temperate regions with cold winters for proper fruit development.`,
            `Major apple producers include China, the USA, India, and European countries like France and Germany.`,
            `They are grown in hilly regions like Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh in South Asia.`
        ],
        cultivation: [
            `<strong>Planting Conditions</strong>:  
                - Requires full sun (6-8 hours daily) and well-drained loamy soil (pH 6.0-7.0).  
                - Thrives in USDA Hardiness Zones 3-8 and needs winter chilling for fruiting.`,
            
            `<strong>Obtaining Seeds or Saplings</strong>:  
                - Stratify seeds in a damp paper towel inside a fridge for 6-8 weeks.  
                - Grafted saplings bear fruit faster (3-5 years) than seed-grown trees (6-10 years).`,

            `<strong>Choosing a Planting Location</strong>:  
                - Select a sunny, well-drained site with rich organic matter.  
                - Avoid frost-prone low-lying areas.  
                - Standard apple trees need 15-20 feet spacing; dwarf varieties need 8-10 feet.`,

            `<strong>Watering & Mulching</strong>:  
                - Water newly planted saplings deeply once a week.  
                - Apply a 2-3 inch mulch layer to retain moisture and prevent weeds.`,

            `<strong>Fertilizing & Pruning</strong>:  
                - Use a balanced (10-10-10 NPK) fertilizer in early spring.  
                - Prune in late winter to remove dead branches and improve fruit quality.`,

            `<strong>Pest & Disease Control</strong>:  
                - Use neem oil or organic sprays to control aphids and codling moths.  
                - Apply copper-based fungicides to prevent apple scab and powdery mildew.`,

            `<strong>Harvesting & Storage</strong>:  
                - Apples ripen in late summer to fall and detach with a slight twist.  
                - Store in a cool, dry place or refrigerate for extended freshness.`
